### Spring Boot with JSF and Primefaces

Demonstrates the use of JSF with spring boot **without any** config files.
This means it works without:

+ web.xml
+ faces-config.xml

All configuration is (or can be) done with code.

The project further demonstrates the mixture of spring and JEE annotations.

Run with `mvn spring-boot:run` and then check http://localhost:8080/home.xhtml
